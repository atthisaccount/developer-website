The specification provides a standard definition of what telemetry data looks like and a description of how to build OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

Specifically, it describes:

- A **data model** for each telemetry data type it supports. This specification includes a protocol for sending data over the wire and conventional attributes for describing data for common operations and technologies.
- An **API** that consists of classes and functions that ensure telemetry data is generated in a consistent way
- An **SDK** with mechanisms for configuring, processing, and exporting telemetry data generated by the API
