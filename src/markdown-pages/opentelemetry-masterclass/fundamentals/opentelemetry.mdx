This lesson is a part of our OpenTelemetry masterclass. If you haven't already, checkout the [chapter introduction](/opentelemetry-masterclass/fundamentals).

Each lesson in this lab builds on the last one, so make sure you learn about [traditional telemetry instrumentation](/opentelemetry-masterclass/fundamentals/traditional-telemetry-instrumentation) before proceeding with this one.

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) is an exciting new standard for open instrumentation, one that's supported by a large developer community composed of end users, cloud providers, and observability leaders (including New Relic). Like its predecessor, OpenTracing, it’s a CNCF project, currently in the [incubating](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?project=incubating) phase of maturity.

OpenTelemetry aims to standardize how applications collect and send their telemetry data to backend platforms. It accomplishes this by providing both a **specification**, including what telemetry data should look like and how it’s used, as well as an out-of-the-box **implementation** of that specification in many of the most popular programming languages.

## Specification

OpenTelemetry is, first and foremost, a specification. It provides a standard definition of what telemetry data looks like and a description of how to build and use OpenTelemetry instrumentation. Specifically, it describes:

- A **data model** for each telemetry data type it supports. This specification includes a protocol for sending data over the wire and conventional attributes for describing data for common operations and technologies.
- An application programming interface (**API**) that consists of classes and functions that ensure telemetry data is generated in a consistent way
- A software development kit (**SDK**) with mechanisms for configuring, processing, and exporting telemetry data generated by the API

Standardized data models are useful because developers and observability platforms can agree on what telemetry data structures look like, how they’re represented in code, and how they’re serialized and transmitted between services. You, the end user, can choose between competing platforms and tools that adhere to the specification with confidence that the data will be generated and formatted consistently.

A standard way to build instrumentation provides consistency across all supported programming languages. If you instrument your application with tools that adhere to the OpenTelemetry specification, you’ll know how they work and that they generate telemetry data in a consistent way.

<Callout variant="tip" title="Specification components">

It’s helpful to compartmentalize the different components of the OpenTelemetry specification. Developers can create instrumentation libraries that comply with the data specification, but that don’t comply with the API or SDK specifications. In other words, their libraries may have different interfaces and configuration mechanisms while still generating and sending data that matches the OpenTelemetry specification.

You learn more specifics about the specification and its components in a later lesson.

## Implementation

OpenTelemetry’s API and SDK specifications define classes, functions, and configuration mechanisms for working with telemetry data. But OpenTelemetry also supplies implementations that comply with the standard in many of the most popular programming languages.

In the last lesson, you learned about the advantages and drawbacks of traditional instrumentation methods. OpenTelemetry implementations offer several benefits over those methods:

- You can use them to send telemetry data to any backend platform (or platforms) you want, and even change to a new one with little effort
- They can be adopted by more tools, providing better end-to-end visibility, especially in distributed systems
- Library and framework developers can build them into their projects, so you don't have to wait for a proprietary agent or open source plugin to support those projects

<Callout variant="tip" title="New Relic’s OpenTelemetry support">

Platform-specific solutions often support more features of their backend platforms than OpenTelemetry does, and New Relic is no exception. While this is true today, as OpenTelemetry matures, this disparity will shrink.

In our [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/introduction-opentelemetry-new-relic/#choice), we compare how our platform supports our proprietary agents versus how we support OpenTelemetry.
